# 🎯 START HERE - MCP Server Quick Start

## ✅ What's Been Created

A fully functional **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** that provides the same worklog functionality as your shell scripts, but with better structure and integration with Cursor.

## 🚀 Quick Start (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Add Cursor Configuration

Edit `~/.cursor/mcp_settings.json` (or use Cursor Settings UI):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "worklog": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/egzonarifi/Documents/GitHub/Aurascan/mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "POVIO_API_TOKEN": "your-token-from-~/.config/povio/worklog.conf",
        "DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID": "15886"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

💡 **Get your token:** `cat ~/.config/povio/worklog.conf`

### Step 2: Restart Cursor

Close and reopen Cursor. That's it!

## 🎮 Usage

Just talk to me (the AI) naturally:

```
"generate worklog for today"
"post worklog with 4 hours"
"generate and post yesterday's work, log 8 hours"
```

I'll automatically use the MCP server tools!

## 🔍 How to Tell It's Working

After restart, try asking me:

```
"what MCP tools do you have access to?"
```

You should see:
- ✅ `mcp_worklog_generate_worklog`
- ✅ `mcp_worklog_post_worklog`
- ✅ `mcp_worklog_generate_and_post_worklog`

## 📚 Documentation

- **[SETUP.md](./SETUP.md)** - Detailed setup instructions and troubleshooting
- **[README.md](./README.md)** - Full API documentation and examples
- **[COMPARISON.md](./COMPARISON.md)** - Compare shell scripts vs MCP

## 🧪 Testing Both Approaches

Your shell scripts still work! You can use both:

**Shell Script (existing):**
```bash
~/.local/bin/worklog/generate-and-post-worklog.sh -t today --post -p 15886 -h 4
```

**MCP Server (new):**
```
Just ask me: "generate and post worklog for today, log 4 hours"
```

Both do the same thing, different approaches!

## 🤝 Sharing with Team

If teammates want to use this:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/GitHub/Aurascan/mcp-server
npm install
npm run build
# Then add to their Cursor config with their token
```

## 🔧 Development

Want to modify the server?

```bash
cd mcp-server

# Edit files in src/
code src/index.ts

# Rebuild
npm run build

# Restart Cursor to load changes
```

## ❓ Questions?

### Where does the server run?
Cursor automatically starts it when you open Cursor. You never run it manually.

### Do I need to keep a terminal open?
Nope! It runs in the background, managed by Cursor.

### What if I don't like it?
Just remove the config from `~/.cursor/mcp_settings.json` and restart. Your shell scripts still work!

### Can I use both?
Yes! They don't interfere with each other.

## 🎯 Next Action

**Ready to try it?**

1. Copy your Povio token: `cat ~/.config/povio/worklog.conf`
2. Edit Cursor settings: Add the MCP config
3. Restart Cursor
4. Ask me: "generate worklog for today"

**Not ready yet?**

That's fine! Everything is built and ready. You can enable it anytime by adding the config and restarting Cursor.

## 📊 Status

- ✅ Code written (TypeScript)
- ✅ Dependencies installed
- ✅ Built successfully
- ✅ Ready to use
- ⏳ Needs Cursor configuration
- ⏳ Needs testing
